# Car-Price-Prediction
Problem Description
The objective of this project is to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as car’s 
model, year of manufacturing, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, etc. The dataset for this 
project is obtained from Kaggle and it contains details of used cars sold in India.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains 12 columns and 6019 rows. The columns in the dataset are:
• Name: Name of the car
• Location: Location where the car is being sold or is available for purchase
• Year: Manufacturing year of the car
• Kilometers_Driven: The total kilometers driven by the car
• Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car
• Transmission: The type of transmission used by the car
• Owner_Type: Whether the car has been previously owned or not
• Mileage: The standard mileage offered by the car company in kmpl or km/kg
• Engine: The displacement volume of the engine in cc
• Power: The maximum power of the engine in bhp
• Seats: The number of seats in the car
• Price: The price of the used car in lakhs

Objectives
• Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset to gain insights about the features and their 
relationship with the target variable.
• Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the 
numerical variables.
• Build a regression model to predict the price of the used cars.
• Evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
• Fine-tune the model using hyperparameter tuning techniques.
• Provide recommendations for feature engineering to improve the performance of the model.
